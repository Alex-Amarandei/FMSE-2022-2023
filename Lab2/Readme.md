### Induction and Recursion in Dafny

<br>

## Tasks

- _Define the natural numbers as an algebraic data type and use it for:_

  - _proving that the successor constructor is injective and that zero is different from `successor(x)`, for any **x**_
  - _inductively defining the addition off natural numbers_
  - _proving that the addition is associative and commutative_
  - _defining a predicate `lt(m, n)` that holds when **m** is less than **n**_
  - _proving that `lt` is transitive._

- _Define a subsort `Odd`, defining the odd natural numbers._

- _Define the parametric lists as an algebraic data type and use it for:_
  - _defining the size of a list (using natural numbers defined above)_
  - _defining the concatenation of two lists_
  - _proving that the size of the concatenation of two lists is the sum of the lists size_
  - _defining a function reversing a list_
  - _proving that reversing a list twice we obtain the initial list_
