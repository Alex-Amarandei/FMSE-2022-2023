### Many Sorted Logic in Dafny

<br>

## Tasks

- _Define a predicate `IsOddNat(x)` that holds when the integer x is an odd
  natural number._
- _Define a subsort `Odd`, defining the odd natural numbers._
- _Define a predicate `IsEvenNat(x)` that holds when the integer x is an even
  natural number._
- _Define a subsort `Even`, defining the even natural numbers._
- _Define a lemma showing that the addition of two odd numbers is an even
  number._
- _Define a predicate `IsPrime(x)`, which holds when the integer x is a prime
  number._
- _Define a lemma showing that any prime number x > 2 is an odd number._
- _Define a type `int32` that represents signed integers with values that range
  from negative **2,147,483,648** (which is represented by the Int32.MinValue
  constant) through positive **2,147,483,647** (which is represented by the Int32.MaxValue constant). Define functions that implements the operations of this type in the same way your preferred programming language does it._
